LANE DETECTION CODING
Main file is detection. There is a huge block commented out in the end, just ignore that lol.
There are three comments in detection.py, those are the only three values that change when switching from video to video

lanes.py contain a lot (and i mean a lot) of comments, if you want to understand the program read that 
Test image 2, 3 correspond to test videos 2, 3
Mask sizes are given just in case you want to switch between the videos
